Next permuts (by Dijkstra's algorithm) generator.

# in.txt:
* 'start permut'
* 'times' - number how much next permuts will be generated
# out.txt:
* 'wrong input' - if input data is wrong
    or
* 'permuts' - 'times' lines of next permuts (if it's not impossible to generate so much permuts, program gets it how it's can)
